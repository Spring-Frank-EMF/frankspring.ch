## Installing Node.js

Download and install Node.js from here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/].

## Change the Execution Policy

We firsts want to install the node dependencies. Following the `Readme.md` we try to run

```bash
npm install
```

This results in the following error output:

```
npm : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded
because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more 
information, see about_Execution_Policies at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
```

This is because of Execution Policy. This defines how powershell scripts will run.

In Default windows desktops, it is `Restricted`, not allowing any scripts (signed or unsigned) only interactive sessions.

So best is you set using `RemoteSigned` (Default on Windows Server) letting only signed scripts from remote and unsigned in local to run, but Unrestriced is insecure lettting all scripts to run.

To set run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` as administrator.

After this, we can finally run `npm install`.

## Running the App

After running `npm install` we can run the website locally as follows:

```bash
npm run dev
```
