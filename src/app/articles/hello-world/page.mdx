import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/ArticleLayout'
import avatar from '@/images/avatar.jpg'

export const article = {
  author: 'Frank Spring',
  date: '2025-05-20',
  title: 'Hello World',
  description: 'A first post using mdx with example code.',

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout article={article} {...props} />

The blog is using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to allow us to write articles in Markdown with React components.
This is a first post using MDX with example code.

## Syntax highlighting code

You can use the code block syntax to add code snippets to your articles. The blog uses [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
<pre>\`\`\`tsx
  `<h1>`Hello World`</h1>`
  \`\`\`</pre>
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Will render a code block as follows:

```tsx
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

## Using images in MDX

You can use the `<Image>` component to add images to your articles. The image will be responsive and will use the same styles as the other images in the blog.

```tsx
<Image src={avatar} alt="" />
```

Will render an image as follows:

<Image src={avatar} alt="" />

## Markdown

```md
## This is a heading 2

### This is a heading 3

This is a paragraph with some **bold** text and some _italic_ text.

And this is a link to [another blogger](https://caillou.ch).

These are ordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And unordered lists:

- item
- item
- item
```

I knew that to get it right I was going to have to replicate the viewing conditions of someone from the future, so I grabbed my space helmet from the closet, created a new Figma document, and got to work.
